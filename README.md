# Bachelor in IT Projects

This repository contains programming projects and exercises developed throughout my **Bachelor in Information Technology**.  
Each folder corresponds to a specific subject or area of study, primarily focused on Python programming and computer science fundamentals.

The purpose of this repository is to serve as a **professional portfolio**, showcasing my progress and applied problem-solving skills as I advance through the degree.

## Repository Structure

| Folder | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| **Python-Programming/** | Introductory projects and exercises written in Python. Covers core syntax, control structures, functions, classes, file handling, and fundamental algorithms. |
| **Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-Python/** | Implementations of classic data structures (lists, stacks, queues, trees, etc.) and algorithmic problems (sorting, recursion, searching). |
| *(More coming soon)* | Future subjects such as Databases, Web Development, Object-Oriented Programming, or Software Engineering will be added as new modules are completed. |
