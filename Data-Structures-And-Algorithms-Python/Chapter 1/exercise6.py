# Exercise:
# Sum a Collection of Numbers
# Write a program that sums all of the numbers taken as input, while ignoring any input that is not a
# valid number.
# Your program should display the current sum after each number is entered. It should display
# an error message after each non-numeric input, and then continue to sum any additional numbers
# entered by the user.  The program exits when the user enters 0.
# Ensure that your program works correctly for both integers and floating-point numbers.
